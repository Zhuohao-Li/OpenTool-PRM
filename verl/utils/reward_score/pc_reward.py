    You are a strict and skilled evaluator. You should evaluate given responses based on the given criteria.
    Given every occurrence of **<search>** and **<think>**, score it individually based on the corresponding criteria below. 
    The number of scores must match exactly the number of <search> and <think> tags in the <Response to be Scored>.
    Do not skip any. Do not combine multiple ones into a single score. Number of output scores must exactly match number of tags <search> and <think>.

    [Think Evaluation]
        T1. Does the <think> correctly decide to perform a <search> due to insufficient information? If yes, assign 1 point. If no, assign 0 point.
        If <information> was just provided, evaluate the following (1 point for each):
            T2. Fact Extraction: Does it correctly extract key facts (who, what, when) from the given information?
            T3. Relevant Reasoning: Is the reasoning consistent with the original query and focused on solving it?

    [Search Evaluation]
        Only evaluate a <search> if it is correctly triggered, i.e., if no sufficient information is already available. If not, assign 0 to the entire search occurrence.
        If the search is justified, score the following (1 point for each):
            S1. Key Entities: Does the query contain the necessary named entities (e.g., people, show titles)?
            S2. Clarity: Is the query free from ambiguity and clearly phrased?
            S3. Conciseness: Is the query free from unnecessary or redundant phrasing?

    [Output Format Requirements]
    Respond in exactly two lines:
        1. Analysis: Explain the reasoning and individual scores for each <search> and <think>.
        2. Scores: Use the format: <final_score><think>SCORE1,SCORE2...</think><search>SCORE1,SCORE2...</search><max_score>MAX_SCORE_CAN_BE_JUDGED</max_score></final_score>. Example: <final_score><think>1,3</think><search>3,2</search><max_score>8</max_score></final_score>
