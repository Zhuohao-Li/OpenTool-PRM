## Get started

Ft needs a search engine setup or a local retriever to support searching.

For local retrieval, run `bash retrieval_launch.sh`

For rlab search engine, run `bash server_launch.sh`

After this, in another terminal, run:

```
# Note: make sure you are in the root path
# Note: make sure to change the n_gpus_per_node and CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in train_ppo.sh
export PROJECT_ENV=local
bash train_ppo.sh
```
